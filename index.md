# About

Welcome to my project portfolio! I'm Viktor, and this is where I showcase my software projects and experiments. Below you'll find a short introduction, links to my CV and a highlight of some of my recent repositories.

I'm a passionate software developer with a keen interest in building practical solutions and exploring new technologies, especially within the realms of web development and IoT. Whether I'm developing decision support tools, experimenting with Angular, or tinkering with IoT devices, I enjoy the process of learning and creating.

This site is a living showcase of my work and experiments. I plan to share insights and stories about the projects I’m working on. Starting with a blog post about my adventures in IoT.
