# About

Welcome to my project portfolio! I'm Viktor, and this is where I showcase my software projects and experiments. Below you'll find a short introduction, links to my CV, blog, and a highlight of some of my recent repositories.

This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and download a print version: [Danish](assets/files/cv-da.pdf), [English](assets/files/cv-en.pdf). 
<!-- The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent.  -->


<!-- Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
