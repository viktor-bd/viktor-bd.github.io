**Welcome, wanderers of the web!** Today’s post is for anyone who’s ever stared at their GitHub stats and thought, “Surely I’ve coded more than this… right?”

Let’s be honest: The journey from coding student to employed developer is paved with half-finished projects, weird experiments, and (sometimes) a suspiciously empty contribution graph. If you’re like me, you just wrapped up your AP in Computer Science, and—despite working on some really cool company projects—your portfolio looks a little… sparse.

Why? Because when you’ve been busy building real things for real businesses, a lot of your code never makes it to your public GitHub. NDAs, private repos, and internal tools don’t boost those green squares. So, what’s a freshly-minted developer to do?

## 1. Farming Commits (the Fun Way)

First things first: You don’t have to push a thousand lines of code every day to show you care. The secret is consistency, not volume. Make a habit of:

- Starting tiny projects that scratch an itch or solve a weird problem (bonus points if you never finish them).
- Refactoring old code—your future self will thank you, and your graph gets a little greener.
- Writing small scripts, even joke ones. Did you really need a Python bot that reminds you to water your imaginary plants? Absolutely.

## 2. Vibe Coding

Not every repo needs to change the world. Sometimes you just want to vibe.

- Try out new frameworks and languages. Make a “Hello World” in something you’ve never touched before.
- Push up playground repos: “angular-playground”, “react-madness”, “rusty-beginnings”—you get the idea.
- Share your config files, dotfiles, or even your favorite VS Code themes.

Remember: The journey is what matters, and seeing your progress over time is as valuable as the finished product.

## 3. Learning in Public

Here’s the real trick: treat your GitHub as a public learning journal.

- Write README files that explain what you were trying to do—even if you spectacularly failed.
- Document your experiments, what worked, what didn’t, and what you want to try next.
- Open issues on your own repos as “to-dos” or “ideas for future Viktor”.

Recruiters who get it will see curiosity, initiative, and a willingness to learn. The others… well, you probably didn’t want to work there anyway.

## 4. Commit to Having Fun

Let’s face it: If you’re not having fun, it’s just another homework assignment. So embrace the weird, the unfinished, the just-for-fun.

- Make a repo for your favorite pizza recipes (bonus points: automate the shopping list).
- Start a “bad ideas” repo and actually try a few.
- Push something silly every once in a while—like a Markdown blog post about how to bamboozle recruiters.

## 5. Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, your public portfolio is just a snapshot. It doesn’t show the late nights, the client calls, or the mountains of code hidden behind closed doors. What it can show is your personality, your love of learning, and your willingness to put yourself out there.

So, farm those commits, vibe out some code, and enjoy the ride. Maybe a recruiter will find this and think, “Hey, this person seems interesting!” Or maybe they’ll just think it’s weird. Who knows?

If nothing else, you’ll have fun, learn new things, and leave a trail of digital breadcrumbs for the next curious developer.
